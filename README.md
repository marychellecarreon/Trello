# Trello

### Overview
  It is a system of boards, lists and cards. This creates a system that allows individuals or teams to track a project
 and collaborate or contribute where they can be most useful or where is it most needed.
 
 * [Board] It is a typically a project or product that is under development
 * [List] It is a way to divide a board into different categories. Typically, a list represents a stage of process (to do, in progress, finished)
 * [Card] It represents a specific element of a project (new feature, components of your project)
    

### Below is the sample that I have made for my sample project : Kids Usage Gadget Track App
 - This way, I have enlisted all the features I want my app to have.

However, in product development, we need to design our program as MVP (Minimum Viable Product) wherein the product that we want to lauch will have just enough features to satisfy early customers which then later on, they can provide feedback for future development.

Thus, we need to review again all the cards listed on Trello to make sure that they are important to our product launch.. 
On above sample I have created, I all those in green label were identified as MVP.
