# Trello

### Overview
  It is a system of boards, lists and cards. This creates a system that allows individuals or teams to track a project
 and collaborate or contribute where they can be most useful or where is it most needed.
 
 * [Board] It is typically a project or product that is under development
 * [List] It is a way to divide a board into different categories. Typically, a list represents a stage of process (to do, in progress, finished)
 * [Card] It represents a specific element of a project (new feature, components of your project)
    

### Below is the sample that I have made for my sample project : Kids Usage Gadget Track App
 - This way, I have enlisted all the features I want my app to have.

However, in product development, we need to design our program as MVP (Minimum Viable Product) which means that the product we want to launch will just have enough features to satisfy early customers which then later on, they can provide feedback for future development.

Thus, since I have listed all the features that I want on my app to have, review is needed to make sure that we are following the MVP.
On above sample I have created, those that were identified as MVP is in green label.
