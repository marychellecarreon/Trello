# Trello

### Trello Overview
  It is a system of boards, lists and cards. This creates a system that allows individuals or teams to track a project
 and collaborate or contribute where they can be most useful or where is it most needed.
 
 - Board
    It is a typically a project or product that is under development
 - List 
    It is a way to divide a board into different categories. Typically, a list represents a stage of process (to do, in progress, finished)
 - Card
    It represents a specific element of a project (new feature, components of your project)
